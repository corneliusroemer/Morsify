## About
I have implemented this project because I have got an old Android watch that the system soft keyboard does not work properly.
I wanted to save notes when I do sports and the requirements were the following ones:
- Easy to use 
- Fully offline
- Save data persistently
- Use a custom keyboard

The idea of using voice notes is not the best option for me.
I prefer to write directly 1 or 2 words by keys and when I arrive at home, I do actions with those stored inputs.

## Special Thanks
This project has been implemented using part of the code and ideas from [Wear-Keyboard](https://github.com/idoideas/Wear-Keyboard) by [Ido Ideas](https://github.com/idoideas).
